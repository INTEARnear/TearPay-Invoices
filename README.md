# TearPay Invoices

A web app that allows you to create invoices.

In the future, when Intents 1click API adds `memo` field, there will be an indexer, list of created invoices, and a way to check invoice status. For now, it's just a demo, and should not be used in production environments because of lack of the indexer (invoice is not marked as paid if you use the same link in a different browser, no webhooks, etc.)
